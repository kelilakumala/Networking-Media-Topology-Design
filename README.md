# Networking-Media-Topology-Design
Computer network design of 3 floors in BINUS University using CISCO Packet Tracer.

This project involves topology design, IP addressing & subnetting, routing, and design of the application layer (HTTP/SMTP - web/email) of each floor. We also considered the types of cables, switch, router, protocols, ports, and domains to be used. 

The design is based on the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model that describes how different computer systems communicate over a network. Across each layer, we determined:
1. **Physical layer** -- cable type (UTP Cable Cat6E), length, and price
2. **Data Link layer** -- switch type (4-port) and price
3. **Network layer** -- router, IP address type (private, class B), starting IP address (using FLSM), subnet mask, and static routing
4. **Transport layer** -- communication protocols with the application layer (TCP, UDP) using ports and socket addresses
5. **Application layer** -- DNS, DHCP, HTTP, and SMTP

_This design was developed for the Computer Network course as an analysis of BINUS University's computer system communication and is not implemented in real life._

The _AoL Computer Network Group 3.pdf_ file contains the description and report of each OSI layer created
